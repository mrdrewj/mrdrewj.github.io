    <p class="sub">A bit about me.</p>

    <hr class="rule">

    <p>
      I'm Drew Jones, an engineer based in Reno, Nevada. I build software, data pipelines, and
      ML systems. My current work focuses on LLM-enabled workflows, NLP, and production
      automation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before moving into software and data, I was an electromagnetic geophysicist. I have
      an M.Sc. in Geophysics from Memorial University of Newfoundland and a B.Sc. from the
      University of Nevada, Reno. I spent years doing field work and research in mining,
      geothermal, and oil &amp; gas exploration before transitioning into data and ML engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m drawn to regenerative farming, sundials, archaeology, cooking, cartography, world history, the history of polar exploration, and exploration more broadly. I’m also interested in astronomy, chemistry, geology, and physics; travel; books of all kinds; the intersection of art and science; sculpting and oil pastel; DIY projects and tinkering; AI and philosophy; and the landscapes and lore of the American West, among other things...
